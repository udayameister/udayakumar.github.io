Although it's primarily an illustration tool, Inkscape is used for a wide range of applications. Inkscape's native file format, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), is a W3C open standard. Vector graphics are made up of points and the lines between them. In Inkscape, these are called nodes and paths. Most vector graphics tools give users the ability to create paths called "primitives" or shapes.
